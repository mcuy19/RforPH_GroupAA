## Part 1: Describing the dataset \n

* What is the data source? (1-2 sentences on where the data is coming from, dates included, etc.) \n

The data comes from the 2011 California Smokers' Cohort (CSC) and was the ninth of a 
series of triennial surveys called the California Tobacco Surveys (CTS) conducted 
since 1990. It was sponsored by the State of California's Department of Public Health 
through a contract with the University of California at San Diego (UCSD). Data 
collection for CLSS began on July 8, 2011 and was completed on December 8, 2011.

* How does the dataset relate to the group problem statement and question? \n

Smoking has been shown to lead to various poor health outcomes. However, some smokers 
are more prone than others to these adverse effects. The question is what characteristics 
and behaviors among smokers in California led to adverse health outcomes.

## Part 2: Import statement \n

* Use appropriate import function and package based on the type of file \n
* Utilize function arguments to control relevant components (i.e. change column types, 
column names, missing values, etc.) \n
* Document the import process \n

```{r importing demographic data}
#import CA Smoker data set
ca_smoker_info <- read_csv("~/PHW251_Fall2022/phw251_projectdata/ca_csc_smoker_data.csv")

#tidying data
ca_smoker_selected <- ca_smoker_info %>% select(c(psraid,smokstat,HOWMANY, SMOK6NUM, SMOK6UNI)) %>% 
rename(ID = psraid, smoking_status = smokstat, howmany = HOWMANY, smok6num = SMOK6NUM, smok6uni = SMOK6UNI) %>%
mutate(pack_year = howmany)

#Hi this is Danni, for the calculation of pack-year, Im not quite sure which columns' data and which equation should I use. I just put the new column there and leave it with the value of "howmany", we can discuss more about it and I'll redo the pack-year column
```

#Hi this is Danni, here is all the columns we need in one table, (pls let me know if any column needed is not here :) Also, the race part seems unclear, maybe we can summarize it in one column that including 15 races.

## Part 3: Identify data types for 5+ data elements/columns/variables \n
* Identify 5+ data elements required for your specified scenario. If <5 elements are required to complete
the analysis, please choose additional variables of interest in the data set to explore in this milestone. \n
* Utilize functions or resources in RStudio to determine the types of each data element (i.e. character, numeric, factor) \n
* Identify the desired type/format for each variableâ€”will you need to convert any columns to numeric or another type? \n

Five variables of interest:
1. Smoking status
2. Race
3. Income
4. Heart Disease
5. Pack years

```{r}
#identify types of each data element
str(ca_smoker_outcome)

#convert data types to appropriate type in new column such as as.factor; as.numeric; as.character
ca_smoker_outcome <- ca_smoker_outcome %>% mutate(new_howmany = as.numeric(howmany)) %>%
  mutate(new_smoking_status= as.factor(smoking_status)) %>% 
  mutate(new_smok6num = as.numeric(smok6num)) %>% 
  mutate(new_smok6uni = as.factor(smok6uni)) %>%
  mutate(new_pack_year = as.numeric(pack_year)) %>% 
  mutate(new_social = as.factor(social)) %>% 
  mutate(new_asthma = as.factor(asthma)) %>% 
  mutate(new_heartdis = as.factor(heartdis)) %>% 
  mutate(new_diabetes = as.factor(heartdis)) %>% 
  mutate(new_othmenill = as.factor(othmenill)) %>% 
  mutate(new_income = as.factor(income))

summary(ca_smoker_outcome$new_howmany)
```

\newpage

## Part 4: Provide a basic description of the 5+ data elements \n
* Numeric: mean, median, range \n
* Character:  unique values/categories \n
* Or any other descriptives that will be useful to the analysis \n

*Smoking status:*
```{r explore smoking status variable}
#number of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(n_distinct(smoking_status))

#names of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(unique(smoking_status))

#tabulate smoking status
table(ca_smoker_outcome$smoking_status)
```
*Race:*
```{r explore race variable}
#number of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(n_distinct(race))

#names of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(unique(race))

#tabulate smoking status
table(ca_smoker_outcome$race)
```
*Income:*
```{r explore income variable}
#number of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(n_distinct(income))

#names of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(unique(income))

#tabulate income
table(ca_smoker_outcome$income)
```
*Heart Disease:*
```{r explore heart disease outcome variable}
#number of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(n_distinct(heartdis))

#names of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(unique(heartdis))

#tabulate income
table(ca_smoker_outcome$heartdis)
```

*Pack Years:*
```{r explore pack years variable}

#change pack year variable from character to numeric
ca_smoker_outcome <- ca_smoker_outcome %>% mutate(pack_year_num = as.numeric(pack_year))

#look at minimum, median, mean, maximum, and # of NAs in pack year
summary(ca_smoker_outcome$pack_year_num)
```
