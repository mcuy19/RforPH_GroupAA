## Part 1: Describing the dataset \n

* What is the data source? (1-2 sentences on where the data is coming from, dates included, etc.) 

The data comes from the 2011 California Smokers' Cohort (CSC) and was the ninth of a 
series of triennial surveys called the California Tobacco Surveys (CTS) conducted 
since 1990. It was sponsored by the State of California's Department of Public Health 
through a contract with the University of California at San Diego (UCSD). Data 
collection for CLSS began on July 8, 2011 and was completed on December 8, 2011.

* How does the dataset relate to the group problem statement and question? \n

Smoking has been shown to lead to various poor health outcomes. However, some smokers 
are more prone than others to these adverse effects. The question is what characteristics 
and behaviors among smokers in California led to adverse health outcomes.

\newpage

## Part 2: Import statement \n

* Use appropriate import function and package based on the type of file \n
* Utilize function arguments to control relevant components (i.e. change column types, 
column names, missing values, etc.) \n
* Document the import process \n

```{r importing demographic data}
#import CA Smoker data set
ca_smoker_info <- read_csv("~/PHW251_Fall2022/phw251_projectdata/ca_csc_smoker_data.csv")

#tidying data

rename(ID = psraid, smoking_status = smokstat, howmany = HOWMANY, smok6num = SMOK6NUM, smok6uni = SMOK6UNI) %>%
mutate(pack_year = howmany)

#Hi this is Danni, for the calculation of pack-year, Im not quite sure which columns' data and which equation should I use. I just put the new column there and leave it with the value of "howmany", we can discuss more about it and I'll redo the pack-year column

## Part 3: Identify data types for 5+ data elements/columns/variables \n
* Identify 5+ data elements required for your specified scenario. If <5 elements are required to complete
the analysis, please choose additional variables of interest in the data set to explore in this milestone. \n
* Utilize functions or resources in RStudio to determine the types of each data element (i.e. character, numeric, factor) \n
* Identify the desired type/format for each variable—will you need to convert any columns to numeric or another type? \n

Five variables of interest:
1. Smoking status
2. Race
3. Income
4. Heart Disease
5. Pack years

```{r}
#identify types of each data element
str(ca_smoker_outcome)

#convert data types to appropriate type in new column such as as.factor; as.numeric; as.character
ca_smoker_outcome <- ca_smoker_outcome %>% mutate(new_howmany = as.numeric(howmany)) %>%
  mutate(new_smoking_status= as.factor(smoking_status)) %>% 
  mutate(new_smok6num = as.numeric(smok6num)) %>% 
  mutate(new_smok6uni = as.factor(smok6uni)) %>%
  mutate(new_pack_year = as.numeric(pack_year)) %>% 
  mutate(new_social = as.factor(social)) %>% 
  mutate(new_asthma = as.factor(asthma)) %>% 
  mutate(new_heartdis = as.factor(heartdis)) %>% 
  mutate(new_diabetes = as.factor(heartdis)) %>% 
  mutate(new_othmenill = as.factor(othmenill)) %>% 
  mutate(new_income = as.factor(income))

summary(ca_smoker_outcome$new_howmany)
```

\newpage

## Part 4: Provide a basic description of the 5+ data elements \n
* Numeric: mean, median, range \n
* Character:  unique values/categories \n
* Or any other descriptives that will be useful to the analysis \n

*Smoking status:*
```{r explore smoking status variable}
#number of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(n_distinct(smoking_status))

#names of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(unique(smoking_status))

#tabulate smoking status
table(ca_smoker_outcome$smoking_status)
```
*Race:*
```{r explore race variable}
#number of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(n_distinct(race))

#names of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(unique(race))

#tabulate smoking status
table(ca_smoker_outcome$race)
```
*Income:*
```{r explore income variable}
#number of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(n_distinct(income))

#names of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(unique(income))

#tabulate income
table(ca_smoker_outcome$income)
```
*Heart Disease:*
```{r explore heart disease outcome variable}
#number of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(n_distinct(heartdis))

#names of unique categories 
ca_smoker_outcome %>% summarize(unique(heartdis))

#tabulate income
table(ca_smoker_outcome$heartdis)
```

*Pack Years:*
```{r explore pack years variable}

#look at minimum, median, mean, maximum, and # of NAs in pack year
summary(ca_smoker_outcome$new_pack_year)
```

*Milestone 3* 
- Subset rows or columns, as needed
- Create new variables needed for analysis (minimum 2)
- New variables should be created based on existing columns; for example
- Calculating a rate
- Combining character strings
- Reordering income to CA - low, med, high
- Pack years -> find avg, and categorize those below “low” and above “high”
- If no new values are needed for final tables/graphs, please create 2 new variables anyway

*taking out values that include don't know to NA*
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

is.na(ca_smoker_outcome) <- ca_smoker_outcome == "(DO NOT READ) Don't know"
is.na(ca_smoker_outcome) <- ca_smoker_outcome == "(DO NOT READ) Refused"
is.na(ca_smoker_outcome) <- ca_smoker_outcome == "NA/Not Applicable"

#subsetting rows  and columns to include only "new" columns, rows include NA 

str(ca_smoker_outcome)
ca_smoker_outcome <- select(ca_smoker_outcome, c('ID', 'new_smoking_status', 'new_howmany', 'new_smok6num', 'new_smok6uni', 'new_pack_year', 'new_social', 'new_asthma', 'new_heartdis', 'new_diabetes', 'new_othmenill', 'new_income'))
```
*creating new variable 1: combining pack years and units*
# Victoria Note: If anyone can assist with the combining of the two values that would be helpful. But only if this variable is worth working on 
# Danni: I think we can leave the pack year number for calculation.
```{r}
library(stringr)
ca_smoker_outcome <- ca_smoker_outcome %>% mutate(smok_daily = str_c(ca_smoker_outcome$new_smok6num," ", ca_smoker_outcome$new_smok6nuni)) 
```

*creating new variable 2: finding average pack years and creating low, average, high values*
```{r}
library(dplyr)
summary(ca_smoker_outcome$new_pack_year)
ca_smoker_outcome <- ca_smoker_outcome %>% mutate(pack_year_avg = mean(ca_smoker_outcome$new_pack_year, na.rm = TRUE))
ca_smoker_outcome$pack_year_avg <- round(ca_smoker_outcome$pack_year_avg ,digit= 0)
ca_smoker_outcome <- ca_smoker_outcome %>% mutate(pack_year_avg_level = case_when
                                                  (new_pack_year > pack_year_avg ~ "above average", 
                                                    new_pack_year < pack_year_avg ~ "below average",
                                                    new_pack_year == pack_year_avg ~ "average"))

```

*creating new variable 3: reordering income to low, middle, high*
```{r}
unique(ca_smoker_outcome$new_income)
ca_smoker_outcome <- ca_smoker_outcome %>% mutate(income_levels = case_when( 
  new_income %in% c("$20,000 or less", "$20,001 to $30,000") ~ "Low income",
new_income %in% c("$30,001 to $50,000", "$50,001 to $75,000") ~ "Middle Income",
new_income %in% c("$75,001 to $100,000", "$100,001 to $150,000", "Over $150,000") ~ "High Income"))
```

*Cleaning - NA values using tables to ensure no weird values*
```{r}
table(ca_smoker_outcome$new_smoking_status, useNA = "always")
table(ca_smoker_outcome$new_smok6uni, useNA = "always")
table(ca_smoker_outcome$new_social, useNA = "always")

table(ca_smoker_outcome$new_diabetes, useNA = "always")
table(ca_smoker_outcome$new_othmenill, useNA = "always")
table(ca_smoker_outcome$new_income, useNA = "always")
```
